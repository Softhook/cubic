/**
 * Moon or Mars ground for a hex tile, after the Regolith mood board (docs/moodboards/regolith/HexSurface.dc.html):
 * a height map painted in colour (red is height, 128 the ground; green marks smooth areas; blue is
 * brightness), then lit once by one filter. Drawn in the board's own units, where a space is 69.3 tall,
 * so its numbers carry over; the tile is scaled to millimetres at the end. Each tile's craters, pits and
 * boulders come from its seed; the world only changes its colour, and adds Mars's dunes, tracks and dust.
 *
 * Chrome ignores the lighting's `kernelUnitLength`, so its relief differs from Firefox's and Safari's
 * (the mood board's Surface study); the game draws each tile once to a bitmap, in the player's browser.
 *
 * The ground is drawn, and lit, past the area shown by `MARGIN`: the lighting reads its neighbours and the
 * shadows and warps reach in from further, so at the filter's edge they'd go wrong, as a grey line.
 *
 * The parts: core (units, the hex flower, SVG helpers), light (the lighting filters), terrain (craters,
 * ridges, dunes), parts (how a piece of a base is drawn, in layers), buildings, craft (ships, rovers and
 * small things) and base (how a base is laid out round its planet's space).
