/**
 * The rules engine's public API: a game is a pure `(state, action) → state` function.
 *
 * Every action type has exactly one handler (the Handlers type makes the compiler enforce it),
 * grouped by topic:
 *
 *   setup.ts      game creation, fleet roll, starting skill, starting planet and ships
 *   actions.ts    Move/Attack, Deploy, Reconfigure, Research, Conquer, end turn
 *   abilities.ts  ship abilities 1–6
 *   combat.ts     attacks, missiles, advancing, Infamy
 *   cards.ts      the card market, Tactic effects and their decisions
 *   effects.ts    the implemented Skill and Tactic effects, as types
 *   skillRules.ts what every skill does, as hooks the rules read
 *   skillActions.ts skills used as an action of their own
 *   turn.ts       start / end of turn, and auto-resolving decisions after each action
 *   legal.ts      legal action enumeration (AI, UI hints)
 *   rules.ts      what differs between rule sets (Basic, Original, Community)
 *   core.ts       shared helpers: errors, log, dice, tracks, cubes
 *   queries.ts    read-only questions about a state (movement, conquering, combat totals…)
 *   lookups.ts    where dice are and what is on a space (no rules)
 *   invariants.ts consistency checks every state must pass (tests, dev builds)
