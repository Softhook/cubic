/**
 * How much each ship power is used in each mode (AI self-play). Prints a table per mode; the
 * assertions only guard the measurement itself, so a prototype power can be judged by eye:
 * a power that is offered often but never used is dead weight, one used every time may be too strong.
 * By default one quick game per mode, so the suite stays fast; the numbers worth reading need more games
 * and level 4, the lowest that uses Flagship transports:
 * POWER_USAGE_GAMES=4 POWER_USAGE_LEVEL=4 npx vitest run powerUsage  (or `npm run power:usage`).
