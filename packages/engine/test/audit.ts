/**
 * Card audit: AI games in which every card gets into play, checked at every step.
 *
 * Each game deals a slice of the mode's skills to the players at the start, so that across a small
 * set of games (modes × AI levels × maps × player counts) every skill is held. At every step:
 *
 * - the AI must find an action, the action must be one legalActions() offers, and the engine must
 *   accept it without crashing;
 * - the invariants must hold;
 * - at a card decision (a pick, Prideful, Ruthless, Calculating, ...), every option offered must be
 *   accepted ("sound");
 * - card oracles: each card's effect, written from the card text and rulings, is compared with what
 *   the engine did when the card applied (e.g. Plundering's first destroy of a turn gives exactly 3
 *   research, a Sabotaged player's next turn has one action less).
 *
 * Any failure is an anomaly. Coverage counts, per card, the turns it was held and the times it
 * fired, so a card that is held but never does anything stands out. The AI self-play benchmark
 * (scripts/selfplay-cards.ts) plays its games through `auditGame` too, without dealing skills.
