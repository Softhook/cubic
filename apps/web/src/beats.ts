// effect is a group. An animation in styles.css reads its group as custom properties (`CUBE.fall` as
// `--cube-fall`, set on the document: `setBeatVars`; only the groups in `CSS_BEATS`, and all of them read
// there); one played from code (Die3D) reads it here, as do its sound (sound.ts) and the staging
// (board/staging, game/strike). An animation with a moment in it to meet (a landing, a hit) is split there, so the moment is where
// one part ends. Change a beat and the animation, its sound and whatever waits on it move together. Timings
// only the eye sees (a trail's fade, a second ring) stay in styles.css, as offsets from these where they follow one.
