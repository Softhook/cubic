 * Full screen for the page. Phones play full screen (the address bar and system bars take a lot of a small
 * screen), and so does the app installed on a computer, which otherwise opens in a window (computers ignore the
 * manifest's full screen). Browsers only allow asking from a click or key, so there it is *wanted* from the
 * start, and the next click or key whenever it's wanted and gone takes it there. Leaving it with the button
 * stops that until the button asks again. So does leaving it any other way on a computer (a held Esc, F11, the
 * window's own button), but not a phone dropping it on its own (the screen locking, another app, the back
 * gesture). A computer's browser tab goes full screen only with the button.
 * Esc is the game's (closing dialogs, leaving review), so where browsers allow, full screen keeps it and is
 * left by holding Esc instead. Not on an iPad: Safari's full screen there misbehaves, and the iPhone has none.
