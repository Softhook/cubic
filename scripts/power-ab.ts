/**
 * Ship power value test: what a ship's once-a-turn power is worth, with nothing else changed (ab.ts).
 *
 * Side B never uses the power of its ships showing `ship` (Regolith's 6, the Wisp's Barrier, by
 * default): it sees the power as already used this turn, so this only works for powers that are once
 * a turn (canUseAbility); a power still offered after that stops the run. Several ships may be given,
 * each tested on its own: `ships=3,6`.
 *
 *   npm run selfplay:powers -- [games=400] [level=3] [mode=regolith] [ships=6] [jobs=fast cores] [margin=5] [seed=0]
 *
 * Any argument may be given by name instead, in any order: `--ships=6 --seed=1` (args.ts).
