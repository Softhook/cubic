/**
 * The A/B value tests (skill-ab.ts, power-ab.ts): the same AI level on both sides of 2-player games,
 * side A with something side B lacks, one variant at a time. Seats swap every game and each pair of
 * games shares a map seed, so a variant worth nothing comes out near 50%.
 *
 * The games are played on the fast cores (pool.ts), a pair at a time; the results are the same with
 * any number of jobs, as each game has its own seeds. Each variant stops early once it is clear
 * whether side A wins `margin` percentage points more than 50%, as much less, or neither ("verdict":
 * better, worse or even; sprt.ts); a margin of 0 always plays them all. One JSON line is printed per
 * variant, in the order given, as soon as it and the variants before it are done.
