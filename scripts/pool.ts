/**
 * Plays a self-play script's tasks in parallel: `jobs` worker processes (the script run again, with
 * POOL_WORKER set) each take the next task as they free up, so fast and slow cores both stay busy
 * to the end. Tasks and results travel as JSON, so they must be plain data.
 *
 * `done` gets the results in task order, whichever worker finishes first, and `skip` (checked
 * before each task is handed out, and again before its result is passed on) leaves out tasks no
 * longer needed: a match stopped early. A worker still playing such a task is stopped, and another
 * started if there is other work (one starts in a fraction of a second, less than a game takes).
 * With tasks that carry their own seeds, the results, and where a match stops, are then the same
 * with any number of jobs. `progress` hears of each task finished, in any order, for a progress line.
 *
 * Call `pool` once, after the script's setup and before its report. In a worker it serves tasks and
 * never returns (the worker exits when the main process is done with it). With jobs <= 1 the tasks
 * are played in this process, in order.
