# Regolith mood board

A look for a moon-and-mech reskin of the hex mode, after *Undaunted 2200* (Callisto, Revolution): the lit
ground, the world and its six mechs, the 44 screenprint cards and the objective colours. The earlier explorations
(survey-style hex map, tile styles, card styles and scale, the mech study, ground × mechs) were removed on
2026-10-24 and are in git history.

| Board | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [Main](Main.dc.html) | Direction, palette, type |
| [Surface](Surface.dc.html) | Photographic ground from one lit height map (height, smoothness and brightness in the red, green and blue channels), before and after, and how Chrome, Firefox and Safari differ |
| [HexSurface](HexSurface.dc.html) | The seven-tile map redrawn from the Surface study's lit height map, weathered, overlapping craters, objectives built round their cube bays (1–4), and plain pip dice in the side colours |
| [RegolithCards](RegolithCards.dc.html) | All 44 Regolith cards (data/regolith.yaml) as the screenprint renderer draws them: each scene is an uploaded render (opened from the repo, the board shows no art); the name, label and rules are board text to retype. Under each card: the Community card it came from, its subtitle, art brief title and the other names from card-ideas.yaml. Carry changes back into data/regolith.yaml |
| [ObjectiveColours](ObjectiveColours.dc.html) | The bases on the objective tiles (7–10, Void) brought into the palette three ways: two inks (Hazard, Oxide), teal and rust, and bone with one signal ink per objective, beside today's, on the moon and Mars. Each is the game's own tile render with the building colours remapped by lightness onto the option's inks; the `objective-*.jpg` renders are its images |
| [World](World.dc.html) | The setting as a screenprint bulletin: the story, the four sides, what it feels like, the objectives and the words ([REGOLITH-WORLD.md](../../regolith/REGOLITH-WORLD.md)) |
| [Roster](Roster.dc.html) | The six mechs: die face, fit, power and the reference silhouettes for each. Their names are the board's Tweaks (*Mech names*), so a rename shows everywhere on the board; copy a settled name into REGOLITH-WORLD.md |
| [Silhouettes](Silhouettes.dc.html) | Our own front-view outline for each of the six mechs, in one ink and to one scale beside a 1.8 m person: a lineup, then one panel per mech. Drawn from each mech's fit, with weight, stance and scale taken from the reference sheets but no outline copied |

**Reference images** (other people's art, for looking at only: not to be traced, printed or shipped):

| Image | What it's for | Source |
|---|---|---|
| [mech-silhouettes.jpg](reference/mech-silhouettes.jpg) | Twelve front-view mech silhouettes: industrial walkers with boxy or domed bodies, heavy and spindly legs, claw, drill and gun arms. The weight and range of shapes for the six mechs ([REGOLITH-WORLD.md](../../regolith/REGOLITH-WORLD.md) *The six mechs*) | Pinterest, `i.pinimg.com/1200x/f0/02/12/f002126832905d7f7582f08f3b746c36.jpg`; artist not credited there. Uploaded to the canvas as `/_blob/171dfca01254210e3507e462e1f69d33`, which the Roster board crops; opened from the repo, that board shows no silhouettes |
| [mech-silhouettes-2.jpg](reference/mech-silhouettes-2.jpg) | Eight front-view mech silhouettes in two rows of four, each beside a human figure: walkers with gun, cannon and missile arms, a shield, a four-legged turret. Scale against a person, and more weapon shapes | Unknown; the uploaded file was named `360_F_2189037674_…`, a stock-photo preview's name, so probably a stock image. Uploaded to the canvas as `/_blob/dc782efb217408f61db8a0ccbf2f0491`, shown whole on the Roster board |

Each board is a static HTML page and opens in a browser as it is. The `support.js` it asks for belongs
to the canvas editor; without it the page draws the same, only not editable. `canvas.json` is the
canvas layout, kept so the set can be published back as a canvas.
